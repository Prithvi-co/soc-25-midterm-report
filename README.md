# 📘 SOC 2025 Midterm – Learning Progress Report

## 🐍 Python Development Journey

I have completed up to **Lecture 76** of the [100 Days of Code – Python by CodeWithHarry](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg).

### 🔹 Topics Covered So Far:
- Variables, Data Types, Input/Output
- Conditional Statements and Loops
- Functions and Modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling and Exception Handling
- Basic Regex, CLI Tools, and Practice Problems

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Explored

### 🧮 Python Libraries
| Library      | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **NumPy**    | Arrays, matrix operations, broadcasting       |
| **Pandas**   | DataFrames, filtering, grouping, summarizing  |
| **Matplotlib** | Data visualization through various plots   |

### 🤖 Machine Learning Utilities
- **TensorFlow** – Model building, training
- **OpenCV** – Image reading, resizing, and face detection
- **Siamese Neural Network** – One-shot image similarity learning
